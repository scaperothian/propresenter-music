# CLAUDE.md — propresenter-music (package: ppsync)

Real-time music alignment: MERT embeddings → rigid/DTW matcher → HMM → scheduled ProPresenter trigger.

## Workflow

**Never commit directly to `main`.**  All changes go on a feature branch and
land via a GitHub pull request (`gh pr create` against
`scaperothian/propresenter-music`).  Branch from up-to-date `main`, push the
branch, open the PR, and merge only after review.  Tags like `v0.1.0` mark
regression baselines — see the tag annotation for verified benchmark numbers
and the repro command.

## Data flow

```
JSON manifest → load_manifest → slides (slide_id, t_ref, t_stop)
Audio file   → load_audio    → [N] float32 @ 24kHz

sliding_window_embeddings(wav, lookback=2s, stride=100ms)
  one MERT forward per [t-2s, t] window (batched), mean-pooled
  → raw_win_embs [N_ref, D]  +  ref_timestamps [N_ref]

fit_global(raw_win_embs)         → global_emb [D]
apply_contrastive(raw, global)   → ref_embs [N_ref, D]  (normalized)

pool_slide_embeddings per slide  → slide_protos [N_slides, D]
build_hmm_transition(t_refs, t_stops, stride_sec) → A [N,N], pi [N]

── saved to .npz ──

Live (per 200ms chunk):
  audio ring buffer (last 2s) → embed_chunk_live(whole window) → mean pool
  → pooled_raw [D]   (buffering until ring + DTW buffer are full, ~6s)
  apply_contrastive(pooled_raw, global_emb) → pooled_norm [D]

  cosine(pooled_norm, slide_protos) → coarse_slide_idx, coarse_conf

  matcher (MATCHER config / --matcher):
    rigid.rigid_align — 1:1 time mapping, mean cosine per offset  (default)
    dtw.align         — top-K cosine candidates + subsequence DTW (live-band)
    → refined_t, confidence, cost_margin

  anchor logic: initial lock (consistency + cost margin) / jump guard
    → obs_accepted, confirmed_t, search window

  HMMPredictor.update(refined_t, conf if obs_accepted else 0, coarse_idx)
    → current_slide, expected_pos_t, trigger_confidence  (fallback position)

  pos_t = refined_t if obs_accepted else HMM expected_pos_t
  select_trigger_boundary(pos_t) → catch-up / next boundary
  TriggerScheduler.update(...)
    → fire now if pos_t past (t_ref - buffer), else arm a timer at the
      predicted crossing (re-armed per estimate; go_to_slide / POST on
      a daemon thread)
```

## Non-obvious design decisions

**Per-song artifact naming (multi-song support).**  Manifests carry `artist`
+ `song_id`; `io.song_slug(artist, title)` builds the `<artist>_<title>` slug
(`incubus_drive`) and `io.song_dir(artist, title)` the per-song directory
(`data/<artist>/<song>/`, e.g. `data/incubus/drive/`).  EVERY per-song
artifact lives in that directory and is named with the slug: manifest
(`<slug>_manifest.json`, the `pp_to_manifest.py` default — `--artist` is
required because ProPresenter annotations store only the title), embedding
cache (`<slug>_cache.npz`, the `ppsync-preprocess` default, written beside
the manifest), benchmark results (`bench_<slug>_<experiment>.json` by
convention, with the song identity also embedded inside the JSON), and
telemetry logs (first line is a `{"event": "meta", ...}` record with
song/artist/slug; the webapp shows it in its header).  The whole `data/`
tree is gitignored — caches are rebuildable, manifests regenerate from the
annotation source.  The cache stores `song_id`/`artist`/`song_slug`; caches
from before this convention fall back to the cache filename stem.  Never
name a new song's files after the audio variant alone ("studio", "live") —
that is exactly the ambiguity the slug removes.

**Live and reference embeddings must come from the same computation.**  MERT
frames depend on their attention context: frames from 30s chunks, 2s windows,
and 0.2s chunks live in *different distributions* and cosine matching across
them fails completely (best match lands at the song's quiet outro).  Both
sides therefore embed full 2s windows in single MERT calls.  Caching per-chunk
live frames is also out: it makes the embedding depend on chunk phase, and a
0.1s phase shift between live playback and the reference grid drops tracking
from 100% to 4% (see `tools/benchmark.py` history in data/incubus/drive/bench_incubus_drive_studio*.json).

**Buffer warm-up gating.**  No DTW, search-window anchoring, or HMM
observation until the audio ring spans the full lookback AND the DTW buffer is
full (~6s).  A 1-frame DTW query matches anywhere with above-threshold
"confidence", and the forward-only anchor then locks the search at a bogus
position permanently.

**Trigger fires on DTW position, not HMM expectation.**  The HMM's
`expected_pos_t` is a probability-weighted average of slide *midpoints* — it
crosses a boundary only after the boundary has passed, so boundary triggers
driven by it fire seconds late or never.  When DTW is confident the trigger
compares `refined_t` against the slide instance containing it (see
`select_trigger_boundary`); the HMM is the fallback during low-confidence
stretches.  On lock-on (mid-song join) or after a boundary is stepped over by
jitter, the CURRENT slide fires immediately as a catch-up — the screen must
show where the song is now — and only instances strictly before it are
skipped.

**Mic capture: native rate + queue draining + silence gate.**  `MicCapture`
opens the stream at the device's native sample rate and resamples each block
(devices often refuse 24kHz).  If alignment falls behind, all queued blocks
are drained into one combined chunk — the audio ring absorbs any chunk size —
so latency stays bounded instead of growing forever.  The aligner skips all
layers while the lookback RMS is under `SILENCE_RMS_DBFS`: ambient noise
DTW-matches the song's quietest section with above-threshold confidence, so
an open mic before the song starts could otherwise walk into a boundary.

**Manifest slide instances vs ProPresenter slide indices.**  ppsync slides are
chronological *trigger events* (a chorus shown 3× = 3 instances), but the
ProPresenter REST API addresses slides by their position in the presentation.
`pp_to_manifest.py` records `pp_slide_index` per instance (repeats share one)
and the presentation `pp_uuid`; both ride through the cache.  Triggering goes
through `propresenter-client`'s `ProPresenterController.go_to_slide(n)`
(1-indexed, ACTIVE presentation); the CLI verifies the active presentation's
uuid against the cache at startup and `--pp-activate` switches to it.  Trigger
requests run on a daemon thread — a slow ProPresenter must not stall the
200ms audio loop.  Enable with `--pp-host`; closed-loop integration test:
`tools/pp_trigger_test.py`.

**Rigid matcher is the default; DTW is for the live-band mode.**  Playback of
a fixed recording does not warp time — only the acoustic channel differs — so
the matcher slides the live query across the reference with the time mapping
FIXED at 1:1 (`rigid.rigid_align`, `MATCHER="rigid"`, benchmark `--matcher`).
DTW's path flexibility absorbs acoustic mismatch by bending time, which shows
up as 0.5-1s position lag and wrong-repeat jumps under mic/PA coloration;
rigid matching made colored-audio results identical to clean-studio results
(14/14 fires at −400ms ±5ms, tracking 0.20s).  Keep DTW for genuinely
tempo-variable sources (live band).

**No Sakoe-Chiba band in `subsequence_dtw`.**  A band of `|i - j| <= k` is wrong for subsequence DTW because the optimal path is offset by the match position, not near (0,0).  The reference window passed by `align()` is already narrow (±`dtw_context_sec` around the candidate), which limits the search space without breaking correctness.

**DTW step penalty (`DTW_STEP_PENALTY`, default 0.0 = off).**  Plain DTW
absorbs acoustic mismatch by *stalling* — repeating a reference frame
(horizontal/vertical DP moves) — which biases the reported end index backward
and lags the position estimate (the documented 0.5–1s DTW lag).  Adding a
fixed cost to every non-diagonal move penalizes stalls and pushes the path
toward the diagonal; in the limit it forces a 1:1 path and coincides with the
rigid matcher (so the penalty is a continuous dial between DTW and rigid).
penalty 0.0 is byte-identical to plain DTW; a clean diagonal match (studio
playback) is invariant because the diagonal is free.  Measured (matched-
recording DTW): it cut studio-Drive fire MAE 272 → 109ms at penalty 0.1 — but
it is **song-dependent, not a free win**: the same 0.1 made studio-Forrest
Frank DTW *worse* (216 → 289ms, 22/22 → 21/22), so there is no universal
value.  Kept off by default; tune per-song via `--dtw-step-penalty` for the
live-band (DTW) mode.  Rigid never calls `subsequence_dtw`, so it is
unaffected.

**Contrastive normalization, not ZCA.**  `apply_contrastive` subtracts the song-level mean then L2-normalizes.  This removes the dominant "sounds like music" direction that makes all sections score ~0.9 cosine similarity.  ZCA from `mert-experiment` is more powerful but expensive; add it if per-slide similarity remains too high.

**HMM transition step mismatch (known, tolerated).**  The transition matrix is built for `stride_sec` steps but `hmm.update()` runs once per 200ms chunk, so the transition prior advances slower than real time.  With confident DTW observations the emission dominates and this barely matters; it is why the HMM alone cannot drive timely triggers (see trigger note above).  Fix by rebuilding A for the chunk interval if the HMM ever needs to free-run through long low-confidence gaps.

**Search window anchoring.**  Once `dtw_confidence >= CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, the lower bound of the cosine search window advances to `refined_t - 2s`.  This prevents backward regression but allows the search to slip back 2s to absorb timing variation.

**Initial lock and jump guard (repeat ambiguity).**  Riff-based songs make the
single best 2s cosine match unreliable — verse/outro/chorus repeats are
near-identical, and one wrong confident frame would ratchet the anchor to the
wrong repeat (observed live: lock onto the outro → slide 14 fires).  Defenses
(`config.py` INIT_*/JUMP_*): before the anchor exists, the cosine search
returns top-K separated candidates and DTW-refines each (lowest path cost
wins), and locking requires `INIT_CONSISTENT_FRAMES` consecutive confident
frames agreeing within `INIT_AGREE_SEC`; after lock, a forward jump larger
than `JUMP_GUARD_SEC` needs `JUMP_CONFIRM_FRAMES` agreeing frames before the
anchor, HMM, or trigger see it — AND the jump target must beat a local
re-alignment near the current anchor by `JUMP_MIN_COST_MARGIN` (a stable
wrong match agrees with itself; only a cost margin separates a real seek from
a wrong repeat).  Locking likewise requires a best-vs-runner-up margin
(`INIT_MIN_COST_MARGIN`) with a 16s pre-lock query buffer.  Triggers never
fire pre-lock.  The DTW query buffer holds `DTW_LIVE_SEC=6s` but starts
matching at `DTW_MIN_LIVE_SEC=4s`, so warm-up stays ~6s.

**Same-slide jump suppression (`aligner.same_onscreen_slide`).**  The cost
margin assumes the CORRECT position is at least locally competitive — true for
studio-against-studio, but under heavy cross-performance divergence (a live
band vs the studio cache) the correct spot can score *worse* than a wrong
repeat, and the wrong repeat then beats the local re-alignment and clears the
jump guard.  Extra guard: a confirmed jump is refused outright when its target
shares `pp_slide_index` with the current anchor — another instance of the same
ProPresenter slide (a repeated chorus) shows identical text, so the jump can
only change tracking for the worse, never the display.  Hold position; the
next DISTINGUISHING section (different `pp_slide_index`) re-acquires normally.
This is what `pp_slide_index` already encodes, so it is free.  Observed:
removed the live-Drive `11_chorus → 14_chorus` jump that skipped the bridge
(studio fires unchanged — every real transition there is to a different slide).

**Live-mean adaptation (mic/PA coloration).**  Live frames are contrastive-
normalized against a blend of the cache's song mean and the live stream's own
running mean (`LIVE_MEAN_ADAPT_SEC`).  Coloration shifts all live embeddings
by a common offset; without cancelling it the instrumental outro becomes
every frame's nearest neighbour (observed live AND on EQ'd test audio).
Trade-off: during the first ~20s the mean is immature and fires can lag ~1-2s
even on clean audio; colored-audio recall goes 0.00 → 0.85.

**Scheduled (timer-based) trigger fires.**  Position estimates arrive once
per chunk and ~processing-latency late, so waiting to OBSERVE a boundary
crossing fires ~100ms late on average plus the processing delay.  When a
crossing is predicted within `schedule_horizon_sec`, the scheduler arms a
`threading.Timer` at the exact predicted wall moment (playback rate is 1.0);
each newer estimate re-arms it, and a confidence drop cancels it.  The
offline benchmark can't use wall timers (it replays faster than real time),
so `wall_timers=False` releases pending fires at their wall deadline in
file-time — including any estimate lag, so the benchmark cannot flatter
itself (regression-tested).

**Cold start.**  The HMM starts uniform; nothing trusts position until the
initial lock (consistency + cost margin) succeeds, at which point
`set_prior_from_coarse()` seeds the HMM at the locked slide and the catch-up
trigger shows the current slide immediately.
